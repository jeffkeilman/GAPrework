File System -

File system is the way your computer organizes files. Some terms:
1. Directories:
folders = directories. 
2. Subdirectory:
Directory within another directory = subdirectory. 
3. Parent Directory:
The folder the subdirectory is in is the parent directory.
4. Root Directory:
The topmost folder in a file system.
A -> B -> C
^ root, parent of B
	 ^ Parent of C, subdirectory of A
		  ^ subdirectory of B

Absolute and Relative paths -
Absolute: starts from the root directory. Like giving someone the exact length and width from (0,0) (long/lat) to find your house
Ex. C:\Users\user\Desktop

Relative: starts from the current directory. Like giving someone turn by turn instructions from where you are on the street

Navigating the Command Line -
Cmd + Space in Mac: Spotlight. Can search for stuff here easily (applications, files, etc.)

pwd: print working directory. Gives you current directory
ls: list command. Gives you list of files/subdirectories in current directory
	-> ls -a: list ALL files in directory, including hidden files (start with .)
cd: change directory. Changes directory to given argument
	-> cd ..: go to the parent directory

Flags and arguments:
command -flag -otherflag
Note: One dash for short options typically (p, d, etc.) and two dashes for the long name of the option

command argument
Ex. cd Downloads <- telling cd where to navigate (relative path)

Controlling Files with CLI:

~ refers to home directory

touch: creates files
mkdir: creates directories
cat: prints contents of files in CLI
mv: moves files from one directory to another. Does not need -r flag to move folders
	-> mv file targetDirectory/ <- slash at end specifies directory vs file
cp: copy file/directory
	-> cp file newFileName
rm: remove. Delete file
rmdir: remove directory. Delete empty folder
-r flag: recursively. Can be used for cp, rm. Will recursively copy/remove all files/folders within a folder as well
as the folder itself.
