Version Control -
We will be using Git for version control and GitHub as a repo

git init: Initializes directory to track changes
git status: Gives you the status of your changes vs the state of the repo
git add X: Adds file 'X' to the list of files that we want to commit next to the repo (staging)
git commit: Commits all staged files to your repo
	-> -m flag: Allows you to add a message to the commit
git log: gives a full history of commits
git diff: shows diff of files you've edited (before staging)

Note: A single file can have both staged and unstaged changes at the same time.

GitHub -
Just a simple intro and tells you how to create an account
